Wireless Code Test

The aim of the test was to produce a console application that webscapes a given url and returns the package items in the form of json to the terminal.

For the webscraping to work correctly you will need to install Selenium:

pip3 install selenium

Selenium is in charge of loading and interacting with a given web page

You will also need to install the Chrome Driver, which can be found here:

To run the code:

python3 main.py

Any tests can be found within the main-test.py file
